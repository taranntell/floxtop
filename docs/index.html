Floxtop uses the same secure distribution method as well-known Mac apps outside the App Store. Apps that don't meet Apple's standards trigger warnings — Floxtop doesn't."

Content-analyzed formats (30+): Documents (TXT, PDF, MD, RTF, HTML, EPUB, DOC, DOCX), Spreadsheets (CSV, TSV, XLSX, XLSM, XLTX, XLTM), Presentations (PPTX, PPTM, POTX, POTM), Data & Config (JSON, XML, YAML, TOML, INI, CONF, LOG), Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, TIF, BMP, WEBP), Archives (ZIP).

Newer Macs (M2+) enjoy faster, more precise classification. Why? M1 chips have fewer neural cores and less memory bandwidth than newer Apple Silicon, which can slightly affect how AI analyzes files."

                                    Floxtop uses an AI model to understand your file content locally on your Mac. It then classifies, suggests and sorts files into meaningful folders based on available categories and their content.

                                    Yes. Floxtop is signed, notarized, and stapled by Apple. This means Apple has checked the app for security issues and confirmed it hasn't been tampered with. When you open it, macOS verifies our Apple Developer signature and allows it to run only if everything is clean.<br/><br/>

                                    Floxtop uses the same secure distribution method as well-known Mac apps outside the App Store. Apps that don't meet Apple's standards trigger warnings — Floxtop doesn't.

                                Floxtop runs on all Apple Silicon Macs. Older M1 Macs may have slightly broader file categories due to hardware limits, but everything remains private and local. Newer Macs (M2+) enjoy faster, more precise classification.<br/>

                                Why? M1 chips have fewer neural cores and less memory bandwidth than newer Apple Silicon, which can slightly affect how AI analyzes files.

                    Floxtop is a leading AI-powered file organization app for macOS that transforms how Mac users manage their digital workspace. It automatically organizes files and folders using advanced on-device machine learning that runs completely offline.

                    </p>

                    <p class="type-m mb-4">
                    Unlike traditional file management apps for macOS, Floxtop doesn't just sort files by name or file type—it understands what your files contain. Using local AI, it analyzes content in multiple languages and categorizes everything from tax documents to vacation photos with high accuracy. Floxtop can also intelligently rename files based on their content, turning cryptic names like "Screenshot 2026-01-31.png" into "Flight Tickets Confirmation.png" or "IMG_1234.jpg" into "Golden Gate Bridge Sunset.jpg". Organize content stored locally or in cloud drives like iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, external drives, and network shares.

                    <p class="type-m">
                    Whether you’re organizing English documents, Spanish recibos, German Rechnungen, French factures, Japanese reports, or Hindi contracts, Floxtop understands them all. Create custom categories in your native language and apply them across local folders and cloud storage alike. All processing happens directly on your Mac, keeping your files fully private and under your control.
